# Real-Time License Plate Anonymizer

A high-performance **computer vision pipeline** that detects, tracks, and anonymizes vehicle license plates in **real-time**.  
It ensures **privacy compliance** while also enabling advanced capabilities like **detection, counting, and tracking** of vehicles.

## üì∏ Demo Images

### Anonymization Example
![License Plate Anonymization Demo](license_anonymizer_demo_snapshot.png)  
*This image shows multiple vehicle license plates blurred in real time using the anonymizer pipeline. Every detected plate is automatically anonymized with Gaussian blur.*  

### Detection Example
![License Plate Detection Demo](license_detection_demo_snapshot.png)  
*This image demonstrates detection-only mode, where license plates are highlighted with green bounding boxes. This mode can be used for counting vehicles or extracting plate details using OCR.*

## üîÑ Core Pipeline

The system is built as a **multi-stage pipeline**.  

### 1. Custom Model Training (YOLOv8)
- A dataset of license plates was collected and annotated.  
- YOLOv8 was **fine-tuned** for robust detection in diverse conditions.  
- Final model weights exported as `best.pt`.  

### 2. Frame-by-Frame Detection
- Each frame is processed with YOLOv8.  
- Output = bounding boxes `(x, y, w, h)` of detected plates.  

### 3. Multi-Object Tracking (DeepSort)
- YOLO detections passed into **DeepSort tracker**.  
- Assigns persistent IDs across frames.  
- Uses Kalman filter + appearance embeddings for robustness.  

### 4. Anonymization / Detection Mode
- **Anonymization Mode:** Gaussian Blur applied to license plate regions ‚Üí privacy ensured.  
- **Detection Mode:** Green bounding boxes drawn for counting/analytics.
