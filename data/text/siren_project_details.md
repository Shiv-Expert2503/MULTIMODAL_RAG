### --- ATOMIC CHUNKS (ARCHITECTURE & METHODOLOGY) ---

#### **1. Project Overview: Representing Images as Functions**

This project implements a SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Network), a specialized neural network that learns to represent an image as a continuous mathematical function. Instead of storing a grid of pixels, the SIREN model maps a 2D coordinate `(x, y)` to its corresponding pixel value (e.g., RGB or grayscale intensity). This approach has inherent advantages for tasks like image reconstruction and generating high-resolution images (super-resolution) from low-resolution inputs.
[NOTE_FOR_EMBEDDING: The core concept is mapping coordinates to pixel values. SIREN is an Implicit Neural Representation (INR).]

#### **2. The SIREN Activation Function: Sine with Omega_0**

Unlike traditional networks that use ReLU or Tanh, SIRENs use a periodic sine activation function. Critically, it's not just `sin(x)`, but `sin(ω₀ * x)`. The `ω₀` (omega-zero) is a frequency scaling factor.
* **Role of ω₀:** A larger `ω₀` (e.g., 30 for the first layer) allows the network to represent higher-frequency details like sharp edges and complex textures. It also accelerates model convergence.
* **Gradient Stability:** A major benefit of `sin(ω₀ * x)` is that its derivatives, like `ω₀ * cos(ω₀ * x)`, are also scaled by `ω₀`. This scaling directly counteracts the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, allowing for stable training of deeper architectures.
[NOTE_FOR_EMBEDDING: The sine activation function with the omega_0 scaling factor is the most important architectural component of a SIREN.]

#### **3. Custom Weight Initialization for Sine Activations**

Standard weight initialization methods like Xavier or He are designed for ReLU or Tanh activations and are unsuitable for periodic functions. This project implements a custom weight initialization strategy tailored for SIRENs, as proposed in the original paper.
* **First Layer:** Weights are initialized from a uniform distribution: `U(-1/fan_in, 1/fan_in)`.
* **Subsequent Layers:** Weights are initialized from a uniform distribution scaled by `ω₀`: `U(-sqrt(6/fan_in)/ω₀, sqrt(6/fan_in)/ω₀)`.
This custom initialization is crucial for maintaining proper signal propagation and enabling the network to learn both low and high-frequency details.

#### **4. Data Preprocessing: Normalization**

The model requires two types of normalization:
1.  **Coordinate Normalization:** The input `(x, y)` pixel coordinates are normalized to the range `[-1, 1]`. This is a standard practice for implicit neural representations.
2.  **Pixel Value Normalization:** The target pixel intensity values (e.g., `[0, 255]`) are normalized to `[-1, 1]` using min-max scaling (`(X/255) * 2 - 1`). This ensures the output of the sine activation function can span its full range to represent the pixel values accurately.

#### **5. Model Architecture and Training**

The SIREN model is a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) where each linear layer is followed by a custom `SineLayer` activation.
* **Structure:** `Linear -> Sine -> Linear -> Sine -> ... -> Final Linear Output`.
* **Input:** 2 features (x, y coordinates).
* **Hidden Layers:** The implemented model uses 4 hidden layers with 256 features each.
* **Output:** 1 feature (grayscale intensity) or 3 features (RGB values).
* **Training:** The model was trained from scratch in PyTorch for approximately 20,000 epochs using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.

#### **6. Interactive Frontend with Streamlit**

The project includes a fully interactive web application built with Streamlit. This frontend allows users to see the SIREN's capabilities in real-time. Key features of the demo include:
* Reconstructing both grayscale and color images from the pre-trained neural network weights.
* Performing super-resolution by querying the learned function at a higher grid density.
* Analyzing model size as a form of image compression.
* Visualizing model performance with PSNR metrics and difference heatmaps.

### `--- FAQ-STYLE REDUNDANCY ---`

* **Q: What is a SIREN?**
    * A: A SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Network) is a special type of neural network that uses sine as its activation function. It learns to represent a signal, like an image, as a continuous function that maps coordinates to values.

* **Q: How is SIREN different from a normal neural network?**
    * A: The main differences are its use of the `sin(ω₀ * x)` activation function and a custom weight initialization scheme designed specifically for periodic functions. This allows it to capture high-frequency details that other networks struggle with.

* **Q: What is the purpose of `ω₀` (omega-zero)?**
    * A: `ω₀` is a frequency parameter. A higher `ω₀` helps the network learn fine details and sharp edges more quickly. It also helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem during training.

* **Q: What can this SIREN project do?**
    * A: The project can reconstruct images from a trained model. It can also perform super-resolution, meaning it can generate a high-resolution image by querying the learned continuous function at more points than were in the original low-resolution image.

* **Q: How was the model trained?**
    * A: It was trained from scratch in PyTorch using the Adam optimizer. The loss function was Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the network's output pixels and the ground truth image pixels.
